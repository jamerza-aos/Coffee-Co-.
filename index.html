        <h1>Our histiry</h1>
        <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 <br> in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after <br> deciding to give up my 9 to 5 job in the <br> city. With no catering experience, the <br> only way I knew how to operate a <br> business was NOT to look at it as a <br> business. I treated it like my home and <br> all the customers were guests in my
            <br> home.
        </p>
        <p>After 13 years, I still stand by the same <br> principle as I have not yet learnt the <br> art of the business but have mastered <br> the art of being a host. We buy the best <br> fresh ingredients and cook the food I <br> serve to my family at home. Everything <br> is freshly cooked on site and served <br> immediately to our guests.
